// Your friend is an event organizer and has asked you to build a website for them. They want to be able to keep track of all the parties they are organizing. They want to be able to see a list of all the parties, add new parties, and delete parties.


// A user enters the website and finds a list of the names, dates, times, locations, and descriptions of all the parties that are happening.
// Next to each party in the list is a delete button. The user clicks the delete button for one of the parties. That party is then removed from the list.
// There is also a form that allows the user to enter information about a new party that they want to schedule. After filling out the form and submitting it, the user observes their party added to the list of parties.


// If you are stuck, try answering the following questions:

    // 1) Which components can be created directly in the HTML? Which components need to be created in JavaScript?
    // 2) Can you render mock data to the page?
    // 3) Can you render real data to the page?
    // 4) Are you able to fetch an array of all the parties from the API?
    // 5) Is state correctly updated to match the data from the API?
    // 6) Are you passing the correct arguments to fetch?
    // 7) Does the API return an error? If so, what is the error message?
    // 8) Is there an event listener on the form? Does it correctly add a new party to the list of parties?
    // 9) Is there an event listener attached to each delete button? Does it correctly remove a party from the list of parties?


// The URL to access a resource in the API is structured as follows:

    // The base URL is https://fsa-crud-2aa9294fe819.herokuapp.com/api.
    // The next segment is your cohort code. e.g. /2109-CPU-RM-WEB-PT
    // The last segment is based on the resource you want to access. e.g. /recipes
// For example, the URL for all recipes for the 2109 cohort would be:
    // https://fsa-crud-2aa9294fe819.herokuapp.com/api/2109-CPU-RM-WEB-PT/recipes
